# El Warsha Art Fair - Voting Platform

## üöÄ 2025 Optimization & Performance Improvements

**This project underwent a comprehensive performance and UX optimization in 2025.**

### Key Improvements
- **Image Optimization:**
  - All artwork images now use Next.js `<Image />` for automatic lazy loading, responsive sizing, and improved performance.
- **Memoization:**
  - All static data (categories, filter options, grouped lists) and derived lists are memoized using `useMemo` for instant UI updates and to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Components like `ArtPreview`, `CategoryTagSelector`, and `BulkCSVUpload` are wrapped in `React.memo` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Skeleton Loaders:**
  - All major tables, lists, and galleries (artworks, judges, votes, admin dashboard) show animated skeleton loaders while fetching data, improving perceived speed.
- **Efficient Data Fetching:**
  - API data is fetched in parallel where possible (using `Promise.all`). Loading states are managed to minimize UI blocking.
- **UI/UX Improvements:**
  - All select dropdowns and filter controls are now instant and smooth thanks to memoization.
  - Buttons and navigation are responsive, and user flows (judges, admins, voting) are optimized for minimal wait time.
  - Role-based redirects and dynamic home page buttons for a seamless user journey.
- **Code Quality:**
  - Lint errors fixed, code refactored for clarity and maintainability.

### Recommendations for Further Optimization
- Ensure all API endpoints use `.lean()` for MongoDB queries and return only necessary fields.
- For very large lists (artworks, votes), implement pagination or infinite scroll.
- Host static assets (images, PDFs) on a CDN for even faster load times.
- Review ARIA roles and keyboard navigation for accessibility improvements.
